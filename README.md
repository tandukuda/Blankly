## 🤖 Built with AI, Driven by a Desire to Learn

I'm not a programmer by background — but I’ve always wanted to learn how to code. **Blankly** is my first step into that journey.

I built this project with the help of [**Claude AI as my coding assistant**](http://claude.ai/), learning by doing — asking questions, tweaking code, breaking things (a lot), and figuring out how to fix them. It’s my way of learning how software is built by actually building something I’d use myself.

Claude handled most of the code, but I made the decisions, tested interactions, and shaped the product vision. This isn’t just a whiteboard — it’s my learning playground.

If you’re like me and curious about code, I hope this repo gives you the courage to start your own thing too.

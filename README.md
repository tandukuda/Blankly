## 🤖 Built with AI, Directed by Curiosity

This project was built using [**Claude AI**](https://claude.ai/) as my coding assistant. I'm not a programmer by background — just someone with an idea, a curiosity to explore, and the willingness to learn by building.

Claude handled the code, and I handled the product direction, interaction design, and decision-making. Blankly is my way of showing that you don't need to be an expert developer to make tools that others can use and enjoy.

If you're curious about how I built it, feel free to explore the codebase, ask questions, or fork it to create something of your own.
